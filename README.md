Title of the application: Ghost – The word game

The goal of my project in a sentence:
Create an app where two players can play the Ghost word game. 
There are two pictures added in this repository, pic1 and pic2. Pic1 explains the flow of the app with arrows. When an arrow points at the top of a screen it means it opens that screen. Two buttons in multiple screens, view high scores and view rules, do not have arrows drawn from them. This is because the page was to small. The view high scores button should be connected to the screen “ghost high” on pic2. The view rules button should be connected to the screen “ Ghost rules” on pic2. 
Features that go beyond the requirements:
- 1.	Player 1 is associated with the color blue and player two with the color red. This will be clear from the color of the edit text background where users fill in their name. Then when the game starts, when it is player one’s turn, the background of the playing activity will be blue. When player 2 plays the background will be red. This color will also be used for the background of the screen that displays the winner. 
- 2.	When a user enters something else than just one letter, a toast will appear, stating that the user should enter a valid input. 
- 3.	Setting the language will be done with the choice of two buttons in the shape of the country’s flag. 
- 4.	The first time the game is ever booted on the phone the most left Ghost setup screen in the sketch in ‘pic1.jpg” will be the first to show. This is the last time this screen will be shown. In this way the user does not have to go by a screen that asks him to change the language and have the option to view the rules. A player will probably know the rules and have the right language selected. 
- 5.	In the settings menu next to setting the language, two options are to clear all high scores and clear all usernames. This might come in handy after a while. 
- 6.	When in the game, there will be a pause button. From the pause screen it is possible to reset the match (this will have the same users) and to change the players. The last option will go to the screen where users enter there user name. By making this distinction the path is shorter when the same players want to start a new game.
